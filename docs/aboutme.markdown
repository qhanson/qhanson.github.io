My name is Yifei Huang (黄毅飞 in Chinese). 
I am currently a GPU Software Development Engineer at Intel (Shanghai). 
I obtained my PhD from the <a href="http://www.sei.ecnu.edu.cn/"> Software Engineering Institute</a> at <a
    href="https://www.ecnu.edu.cn">East China Normal University</a>. 

I was advised by Professor Changbo Wang and <a href="//chenhui.li">Chenhui Li</a>. I was also luckily advised by <a href="https://liaojing.github.io/html/">Jing Liao</a>   and <a href="https://personal.utdallas.edu/~xguo/">Xiaohu Guo</a>.

My research focuses on content creation and applying novel techniques to re-create the visual content.
